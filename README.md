# hello-world
hello-world repository for CS50x

Well, what can I say about myself that you might find interesting? A few weeks ago - due to family reasons - I decided to look at the types 
of programming jobs available in Germany. It seems like Java and Ruby on Rails are very sought after skills.
Anyway - I have no coding experience and so this is all brand new for me. I'm hoping to learn Java and Kotlin and see if I can try my hand at Android app development.
